# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published version and the latest development version (last commit) are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, create a new draft security advisory at [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/security/advisories/new).

Security issues are handled with top priority. If you don't receive a response within a week, please follow up on the report. Once a vulnerability is acknowledged, a fix should be available and a new version released within a few days. The issue will be made public after the fix is released or if the report is declined.
